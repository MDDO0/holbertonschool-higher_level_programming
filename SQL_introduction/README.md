# SQL - Introduction

This project is part of the curriculum at Holberton School.

The goal of this project is to get familiar with the basics of SQL and relational databases using MySQL 8.0. You will learn how to:
- Create databases and tables
- Insert and retrieve data
- Use SQL queries to filter, sort, and group data
- Use SQL syntax properly and write clean code with comments

## Files and Descriptions

| File Name         | Description                                        |
|------------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| 0-list_databases.sql | Lists all databases on the MySQL server          |
| 1-create_database.sql | Creates a database named `hbtn_0c_0`            |
| 2-remove_database.sql | Deletes the database `hbtn_0c_0` if it exists   |
| 3-list_tables.sql     | Lists all tables of a database                  |
| 4-first_table.sql     | Creates a table called `first_table`           |
| ...                  | ... (add your remaining tasks here)            |

## Requirements

- SQL keywords must be written in uppercase (e.g., SELECT, WHERE, etc.)
- Each `.sql` file must start with a comment describing the task
- Each SQL query must be preceded by a comment explaining what it does
- Files must end with a new line
- Only `vi`, `vim`, or `emacs` editors are allowed
- Code is tested on Ubuntu 20.04 with MySQL 8.0.25
